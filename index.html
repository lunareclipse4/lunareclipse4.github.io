          <h2>Writer's Block? Use the Internet to Inspire Your Creative Writing</h2>

            <a href="https://medium.com/@kuhlar4/writers-block-use-the-internet-to-inspire-your-creative-writing-7b154e6e9c08"> Creative Writing </a> can be difficult, especially when you're not feeling inspired. Everyone has experienced the dreaded "writer's block" at some point in their lives, and while at the moment you may feel doomed to possess a vacant mind forever, I can assure you that's not true. You just need the inspiration to spark your own radiant creativity. Luckily, the Internet provides one of the greatest tools for inspiration, if you know where to look. </p>

          <h2>Romanticize Your Life: 8 Ways to Relax & Reduce Anxiety</h2>


          <p class="description">
            As a college student, I deal with anxiety all the time from the daily stresses of life. I wanted to make   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00VH6h73ti0"> a video </a>  showing some of the ways I reduce and manage anxiety by romanticizing my life. Whether you are a college student, a high school student, or someone else, I think that these ways of mitigating anxiety can work for you. Sometimes all it takes is a different mindset and perspective to snap out of that anxiety and when you romanticize your life, you'll see life as the idealized situation that it could be. Make everything you do aesthetic and take time out of your day to practice mindfulness so that you can be relaxed, anxiety-free, and live your very best life.  </p>
